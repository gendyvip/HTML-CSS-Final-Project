                        I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
                        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                        the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

                    <p>   Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
                    <q>
                        Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
                        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
                        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
                        could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
                        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
                        100% recommend!

                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
                Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
                Lorem
                Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
                undoubtable
                source. <br><br>Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
                (The Extremes
                of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very
                popular
                during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line
                in
                section 1.10.32.
